# Kaitai Struct Compiled

This directory contains the compiled Kaitai Struct parsers used in the delta-debugging project.
The parsers are generated from `.ksy` files using the Kaitai Struct compiler.

Do not edit these files directly; instead, modify the corresponding `.ksy` files and recompile them.

Please refer to the [Kaitai Struct User Guide](https://doc.kaitai.io/user_guide.html) for more information.
